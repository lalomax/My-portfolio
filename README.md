## About Me

I'm a web developer and learning enthusiast based out of Bolivia, BO. I love building apps that solve real-world problems, and that are delightful to use. My specialities include React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Styled Components.

My background is in control and developing web, and I have a bachelors degree in Systems from El Alto's Public University (UPEA). I also like to hiking.

Happy Coding!
